PyInstaller - look at using this to setup the onefile compiled product which will have database structure inside and baseline codebase.

*NOTE: Need to be able to PyInstaller the PyInstaller or Custom package? When seperating database

Moving forward without onefile solution plan of attack (consider py2exe). This means have a py script for interacting and building sqlite databases (SPONGEs).

Need to look at packaging eggs and easy_install with database

Fixed function calls from argparse but argcomplete not working yet (still need to explore more tab completion). Need to think about how UI should be called?

Need to think of names for python and sqlite database parts of the SPONGE framework. Right now will call the main python the SPONGE core and each respective "flow" generated by the framework a SPONGE species.

Does this project need SQLAlchemy? Gains/Loses?

Now onto auto function ripping.
